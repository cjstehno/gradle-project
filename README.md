# Gradle Project Docs Plugin

Gradle plugin providing helpful tools and configuration used to create and manage a project website and other documentation.

This plugin is primarily a collection of conventions and tasks that I use across most of my projects, therefore it is quite opinionated, but hopefully it will be useful to others as well.
